# Odysee MVP (UI Branch)

This is the UI branch. This only contains a stripped version of the Roku app for planning and integration purposes.
The code will not make any HTTP requests and will use placeholders. This is to allow planning endpoints for upcoming features.
UI Elements will be defined identically to the production app and this branch will (hopefully) eventually be referenced as a dependency by the indev branch.

This should hopefully allow UI contributions without breaking existing code.
