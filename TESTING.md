# Testing:

1. Pull the latest dev release from the [device-flow](https://github.com/lbryio/odysee-roku/tree/device-flow) branch and [run it using the Brightscript extension for VSCodium/Code](INSTALL.md).
1. Use/abuse it as normal.
1. If it crashes, send me a bug report.

### Bug report format:
1. The sequence of events leading to the bug
1. Link to debug output
1. Link to video of bug (HDMI capture preferred, but camera video will suffice as well)

### Example:

I tried to go from the search bar to the keyboard, but it transitions over the keyboard and to the history instead.
