# Testing:
### If you would like to help the Unofficial Odysee channel, you can run the [edge version](https://my.roku.com/account/add?channel=odyseeunofficialedge).

### If you find a bug on Edge:
1. Pull the latest dev release from Github ([indev](https://github.com/lbryio/odysee-roku/tree/indev) branch)
1. Follow the instructions in install.md
1. If the same bug occurs on devel or is not known, file a bug report:

### Bug report format
1. The sequence of events leading to the bug
1. Link to debug output
1. Link to video of bug (HDMI capture preferred, but camera video will suffice as well)

### Example:

I tried to go from the search bar to the keyboard, but it transitions over the keyboard and to the history instead.
